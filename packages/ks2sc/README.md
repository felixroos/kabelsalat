# ks2sc

in this experiment, kabelsalat acts as a frontend for SuperCollider, generating sclang code. Assuming you have SuperCollider installed, and `sclang` is in your PATH (test by running `sclang` in a terminal), you can run the ks2c repl like this:

```sh
node ks2sc.js
```

now you can enter kabelsalat code, like:

```plaintext
saw(55).lpf(sine(2).add(1.5).mul(300))
```

this is the mapping from kabelsalat to sc ugens:
