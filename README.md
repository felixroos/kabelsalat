# kabelsalat

an experimental live-codable modular synthesizer.

- main site at [kabel.salat.dev](https://kabel.salat.dev)
- docs at [kabel.salat.dev/learn](https://kabel.salat.dev/learn/)

## Project Setup

You need [nodejs v22](https://nodejs.org/en) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Then run `pnpm i` to install dependencies.

## Running Offline

1. `pnpm build` to build the site
2. `pnpm preview` to serve the build

## Develop

- `pnpm dev` run the dev server
- `pnpm test` run tests

## Publishing

```sh
npm login

# this will increment all the versions in package.json files of non private packages to selected versions
npx lerna version --no-private

# publish all packages inside /packages using pnpm! don't use lerna to publish!!
pnpm --filter "./packages/**" publish --dry-run

# the last command was only a dry-run. if everything looks ok, run this:
pnpm --filter "./packages/**" publish --access public
```

## Experimental "Desktop" Version

There is an experimental "Desktop" version, which serves the built site as a binary (<10MB).
It's without UI, so you still have to open it in your browser, but it's self-contained, so it works offline and all code is baked into the binary.

```sh
pnpm build # build site to website/dist
# make sure you have go installed
pnpm build-bin # builds all binaries
./bin/kabelsalat-darwin-arm64 # run site
# go to http://localhost:8080
```

Currently it builds Linux and MacOS binaries, but adding others should be trivial.

## Packages

- [core](./packages/core/) core graph language + compiler
